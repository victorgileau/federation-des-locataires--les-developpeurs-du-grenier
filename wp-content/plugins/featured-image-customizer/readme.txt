### Does it work on Gutenberg?

The **Featured Image** button is available on Classic and Guttenberg Block editors inside the featured image meta box.

### Can we make Advanced Options dynamic?

Once we clear all the layouts, we will start to enable some of the advanced options and make them dynamic so you can additionally customize your featured images.

### Does it support multisite?

Yes, the plugin is tested and works on WordPress multisite.

### Do you store any files locally?

All brand logos are loaded from 3rd party API. We store the logos you use most on your server locally to save bandwidth.
